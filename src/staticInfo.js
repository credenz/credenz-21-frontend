    rules: [
      "A maximum of 1 participant pursuing under-graduate program at their institution is allowed to participate",
      "The participants must keep their college verification in handy as you can be asked to disclose it any point of time. Before the final round, all participants will be asked to verify their identity as an under-graduate student and failure to do so will lead to immediate disqualification.",

    structure: `1)There are two rounds in RC:
a)Logic Round (elimination)
b)Decipher and code Round (final)
2)Participants can register via the Credenz app or the website.
3)The event will be divided into two levels, Junior and Senior where the difficulty will vary accordingly. All the levels will test out your knowledge of C/C++ and Python.
4)The FE and SE participants will be taking on the Junior Category and the TE and BE participants will take on the Senior Category.
5)The participants clearing out the cut off score in round 1 will be notified for round 2 and will be able to participate in the final round for the prize.`,
    judging: `1) Judging in round 1 will be based on the correctness of the decoded mathematical pattern with or without coding.
2) Judging for round 2 will be based on the time and space efficiency of your code to solve the given challenges in restricted time.
